**ReacType** is a visual prototyping tool for developers employing **React** component architecture alongside the comprehensive type checking of **TypeScript**.
In other words, **you can draw prototypes and export React / Typescript code!**

**ReacType** allows the user to _visualize_ their application architecture dynamically, employing a _drag-and-drop canvas display_ and a _real-time component code preview_. The user can create components and drag _instances_ of these components, as well as HTML elements, onto the canvas. This architecture can then be _exported_ as TypeScript application files to be used as a starter template for any repository.

**New with version 3.0:**

- Export code as a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project
- Create nestable components/HTML elements using a drag-and-drop canvas
- Add CSS to any element on the canvas
- Components and HTML canvas elements are rendered in the canvas in the same way they'll be rendered in the exported project
- View dynamically generated Next.js or classic React code as you build your project
- Authenticate with Github or email
- Save data for multiple projects in the cloud
- Critical Electron security gaps resolved

Download for [MacOS](https://github.com/team-reactype/ReacType/releases), [Windows](https://github.com/team-reactype/ReacType/releases/), [Linux](https://github.com/team-reactype/ReacType/releases/).

- **Mac users**: After opening the dmg and dragging ReacType into your Applications folder, ctrl+click the icon and select 'Open' from the context menu to run the app. This extra step is necessary since we don't have an Apple developer license yet.

- **Linux users**: Run the application as a super user in order to read and write files.

### How to use

- **Log in:** Sign up through email/Github if you would like to save your projects to the cloud. Otherwise, select _Continue as Guest_
- **Select project type:** By default, new projects will be Next.js projects, but you can toggle your project to be a normal React application by selecting "Classic React" in the bottom-right corner.
  - **Next.js** projects allow you to easily create routing between pages within ReacType and render content with static rendering.
  - **Classic React** projects are vanilla React. You can create multiple "root" components, but routing between these root components is enabled by default.
- **Add components:** Add a new component in the left panel. If the _Page_ checkbox is selected, the component will become a page that can be routed to. For example, a page component named 'Home', the component's corresponding route will be '/Home'. [Learn more about Next.js routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).
- **Create instances of components/HTML elements:** Each component has its own canvas where you can see how any instances of nested components or HTML elements will render in production. To create an instance of a component or traditional HTML element in the canvas, simply drag it onto the canvas. The following elements have special properties when they're dragged onto the canvas:
  - **Page/root components:** Page/root components cannot be dragged into other components.
  - **Divs:** Divs are arbitrarily nestable.
  - **Navigation components:** Next.js projects have "Navigation components" which allow you to create links between your page components.
- **Update CSS and delete instances:** Click on the component canvas or an instance to view/edit CSS attributes in the right panel. Updates made to the CSS will render in the canvas on _Save_.
- **Save your project:** Select _Save Project_ to save a new project to the cloud. Once you've created a new project in the cloud, it will be autoamtically saved on each change. You can open any of your other saved projects by selecting _Open Project_.
- **Export your project:** Select _Export Project_ to save your project locally. You will have the option of exporting either a fully functional application or only exporting the component files.

## To Run Your Own Version

- **Fork** and **Clone** Repository.
- Open project directory
- Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

- To run the production build

```bash
npm run prod
```

- To run the development build

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Please note that the development build is not connected to the production server. `npm run dev` should spin up the development server from the server folder of this repo. For additional information, the readme is [here](https://github.com/open-source-labs/ReacType/blob/master/server/README.md). Alternatively, you can also select "Continue as guest" on the log-in page of the app to not use any features that rely on the server (authentication and saving project data.)

## To Run Your Exported Next.js Project

- Open exported project directory
- Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

- Build the app

```bash
npm run build
```

- Start an instance

```bash
npm run start
```

- Open browser and navigate to localhost at specified port
